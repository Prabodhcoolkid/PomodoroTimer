# PomodoroTimer
Python Pomodoro Gui project for:
- Practicing Git version control and project management
- Building a TKINTER app with interactable settings and UI

Goals:
- Add setting feature, to change timer settings
- Add feature that shows total worktime across days, months and year of using the app
- Package into an exe file, and sell it for 1 or 2 dollars, or maybe as a monthly subscription
